&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8658; This is my first contribution to the Swarmops project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8658; I'm the first french translator in this project. So the Translation memory is totally empty. the thing that have pushed me to do some extra researches.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8658; I tried as hard as i can to provide a clean presentation where all the information needed are present.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8658; As for my first contribution, here is the proof <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JK2RU7j.png"> [Proof] </a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8658; In this session, the translation was pretty easy. there was some redundancy at the same file, i tried to count this repeated words in order to get an exact final word count.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8658; The translation done in this part was on the following files : 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#164;"Logic.Swarm.Position.resx"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#164; "Logic.Swarm.Position.resx"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#164; "Logic.Structure.Country.resx" 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#164;"Logic.Communications.Transmission.DefaultCommTemplates.resx"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8658; The translation was turning around some financial vocabulary, and some security precaution of Swarmops use.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8658; Almost all the strings translated until now had a clear context and does not need a context request in my opinion.
